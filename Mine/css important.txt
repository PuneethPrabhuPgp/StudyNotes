	There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

				External CSS
				Internal CSS
				Inline CSS
				
	Margin is outer space of an element, while padding is inner space of an element
	
Note: when to use tag_name.class_name

					p.center {
					  text-align: center;
					  color: red;
					}

					<h1 class="center">This heading will not be affected</h1>
					<p class="center">This paragraph will be red and center-aligned.</p> 

1)A.className  (ex:same level selection)
	You can combine the class selector with other selectors, like the type selector	

2)A  *  (ex:div *)
	This selects all elements inside of A

3)A + B (p + div only 2nd div is selected)
	This selects all B elements that directly follow A. Elements that follow one another are called siblings. They're on the same level, or depth. 
	In the HTML markup for this level, elements that have the same indentation are siblings.

4)A ~ B (p ~ div all div after p)
	You can select all siblings of an element that follow it. 
	This is like the Adjacent Selector (A + B) except it gets all of the following elements instead of one.	

5)A > B (p > div selects only 1 but p div selects both 1 and 2)
	You can select elements that are direct children of other elements. 
	A child element is any element that is nested directly in another element.	

6):first-child :only-child :last-child :nth-child(count) :nth-last-child(count)		

7):first-of-type
	Selects the first element of that type within another element.
	Examples
	span:first-of-type selects the first span in any element.		

8):nth-of-type(A)
	Selects a specific element based on its type and order in another element - or even or odd instances of that element.
	Examples
	div:nth-of-type(2) selects the second instance of a div.
	.example:nth-of-type(odd) selects all odd instances of a the example class.			

9):nth-of-type(An+B) [:only-of-type,:last-of-type,:empty]
	The nth-of-type formula selects every nth element, starting the count at a specific instance of that element.
	Examples
	span:nth-of-type(6n+2) selects every 6th instance of a span, starting from (and including) the second instance.

10):not(X)
	You can use this to select all elements that do not match selector "X".
	Examples
	:not(#fancy) selects all elements that do not have id="fancy".
	div:not(:first-child) selects every div that is not a first child.
	:not(.big, .medium) selects all elements that do not have class="big" or class="medium".

11)[attribute]
	Attributes appear inside the opening tag of an element, like this: span attribute="value". 
	An attribute does not always have a value, it can be blank! [attribute="value"] valid.

12)Select all elements with an attribute value that starts with specific characters
	[attribute^="value"]

13)Select all elements with an attribute value that ends with specific characters
	[attribute$="value"]

14)Attribute Wildcard Selector

	The [attribute*="value"] selector is used to select elements whose attribute value contains a specified value.

	The following example selects all elements with a class attribute value that contains "te":

	Note: The value does not have to be a whole word!  

	Example
	[class*="te"] {
	  background: yellow;
	}

15)Set a background color on all <div> elements that have a class attribute value containing "test":

	div[class*="test"] {
	  background: #ffff00;
	}

	Set a background color on all elements that have a class attribute value containing "test":
	[class*="test"] {
	  background: #ffff00;
	}

16)The [attribute] selector is used to select elements with a specified attribute.

	The following example selects all <a> elements with a target attribute:

	Example
	a[target] {
	  background-color: yellow;
	}
	
17)The [attribute="value"] selector is used to select elements with a specified attribute and value.

	The following example selects all <a> elements with a target="_blank" attribute:

	Example
	a[target="_blank"] {
	  background-color: yellow;
	}

18)The [attribute~="value"] selector is used to select elements with an attribute value containing a specified word.

	The following example selects all elements with a title attribute that contains a space-separated list of words, one of which is "flower":

	Example
	[title~="flower"] {
	  border: 5px solid yellow;
	}
	
19)The [attribute|="value"] selector is used to select elements with the specified attribute starting with the specified value.

	The following example selects all elements with a class attribute value that begins with "top":

	Note: The value has to be a whole word, either alone, like class="top", or followed by a hyphen( - ), like class="top-text"! 

	Example
	[class|="top"] {
	  background: yellow;
	}
	
20)The [attribute^="value"] selector is used to select elements whose attribute value begins with a specified value.

	The following example selects all elements with a class attribute value that begins with "top":

	Note: The value does not have to be a whole word! 

	Example
	[class^="top"] {
	  background: yellow;
	}

21)The [attribute$="value"] selector is used to select elements whose attribute value ends with a specified value.

	The following example selects all elements with a class attribute value that ends with "test":

	Note: The value does not have to be a whole word!  

	Example
	[class$="test"] {
	  background: yellow;
	}
	
22)The attribute selectors can be useful for styling forms without class or ID:

	Example
	input[type="text"] {
	  width: 150px;
	  display: block;
	  margin-bottom: 10px;
	  background-color: yellow;
	}

	input[type="button"] {
	  width: 120px;
	  margin-left: 35px;
	  display: block;
	}
