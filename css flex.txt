1) "justify-content" :
		property, which aligns items horizontally and accepts the following values:
	
flex-start: Items align to the left side of the container.
flex-end: Items align to the right side of the container.
center: Items align at the center of the container.
space-between: Items display with equal spacing between them.
space-around: Items display with equal spacing around them.

2)"align-items" :
		This CSS property aligns items vertically and accepts the following values:

flex-start: Items align to the top of the container.
flex-end: Items align to the bottom of the container.
center: Items align at the vertical center of the container.
baseline: Items display at the baseline of the container.
stretch: Items are stretched to fit the container.

3)"flex-direction" :
		This CSS property defines the direction items are placed in the container, and accepts the following values:
		
row: Items are placed the same as the text direction.
row-reverse: Items are placed opposite to the text direction.
column: Items are placed top to bottom.
column-reverse: Items are placed bottom to top.

4)"order" :
		Sometimes reversing the row or column order of a container is not enough. In these cases, we can apply the order property to individual items. By default, items have a value of 0, 
		but we can use this property to also set it to a positive or negative integer value :

(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2).

5)"align-self":
		Another property you can apply to individual items is align-self. 
		This property accepts the same values as align-items and its value for the specific item.

6)"flex-wrap" :
		property, which accepts the following values :

nowrap: Every item is fit to a single line.
wrap: Items wrap around to additional lines.
wrap-reverse: Items wrap around to additional lines in reverse.

7)"flex-flow" :
		The two properties flex-direction and flex-wrap are used so often together that the shorthand property flex-flow was created to combine them. 
		This shorthand property accepts the value of one of the two properties separated by a space.
		For example, you can use "flex-flow: row wrap" to set rows and wrap them.
		Try using flex-flow to repeat the previous level.
	
8)"align-content" :
		to set how multiple lines are spaced apart from each other. This property takes the following values:
		
flex-start: Lines are packed at the top of the container.
flex-end: Lines are packed at the bottom of the container.
center: Lines are packed at the vertical center of the container.
space-between: Lines display with equal spacing between them.
space-around: Lines display with equal spacing around them.
stretch: Lines are stretched to fit the container.
