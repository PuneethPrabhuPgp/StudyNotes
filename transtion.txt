1)CSS transitions allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration.

2)To create a transition effect, you must specify two things:

	the CSS property you want to add an effect to
	the duration of the effect

	Note: If the duration part is not specified, the transition will have no effect, because the default value is 0.
	
	Example: transition: width 2s,height 3s; it is applied when width and height is changed.
	
3)The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.

4)The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.

		The transition-timing-function property can have the following values:

		ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default) 
		linear - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end
		ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start
		ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end
		ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end
		cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function (we can give a curve, check cubic bezier on cubic.bezier.com)
		
	ease is like ease-in-out , except it starts slightly faster than it ends.
	
5)The transition-delay property specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect.
	Transition will start after seconds sepecified.
	
6)insted of specifing in one line we can use
	transition-property: width;
	transition-duration: 2s;
	
7)all properties in one line:
	transition: width 2s linear 1s;
	
	
	
	.square{
		width:200px;
		height:200px;
		background-color: pink;
		/* transition: width 2s,height 3s; 
		transition-property: width,height;
		transition-duration: 2s;
		transition-delay: 1s;
		transition-timing-function: linear;*/
		transition: width 2s linear 0.5s,height 2s linear 0.5s; //(we can change order)
	}

	.square:hover{
		width:300px;
		height:300px;
	}
