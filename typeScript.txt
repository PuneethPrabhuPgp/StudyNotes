As we know Js is a dynamci language, to make it static type we can use TypeScript.

Typescript is built on top of javascript, and it has to be compiled to JS to run it.

To convert typescript to JS it makes use of TSC compiler.

Features of Typescript:

1) Typescript makes javascript variables type specific so it helps us avoiding potenial bugs that occurs during runtime.
2) TypeScript also allows feature implementation of Javascript.

to install typescript we need node environment
npm install -g typescript ts-node

Primitive types -> string , number, bigint, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, any, unknown, void, never, union , intersection
Object types -> array, classes , functions, tuples,  etc.

-----------------------------------
Unknown vs any
-------------------------------------

any value can be assigned to unknown and any

Diiference :

the value of any can be assigned to an other variable and we can call the method of other type
the value of unknown cannot be assigned to other variable type and we cannot call the methiod of other type

Ex:
let vAny: any = 10;          // We can assign anything to any
let vUnknown: unknown =  10; // We can assign anything to unknown just like any


let s1: string = vAny;     // Any is assignable to anything
let s2: string = vUnknown; // Invalid; we can't assign vUnknown to any other type (without an explicit assertion)

vAny.method();     // Ok; anything goes with any
vUnknown.method(); // Not ok; we don't know anything about this variable

Different ways to create multiple inheritence in typescript
------------------------------------------

class A implements InterfaceA , InterfaceB

1) through interfaces

2) through mixins
